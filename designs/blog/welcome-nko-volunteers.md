# Give a big warm welcome to the NKO 2013 Volunteers and a big thank you to the TokBox team

You read it right! We have this year with us, an amazing group of people that volunteered themselves to help you during the 48 hours of hackathon!

If you feel that you need some support, don't hesitate to ask, for that you can send an email to help@nodeknockout.com, or join us at our IRC Channel on Freenode, the #nodeknockout.

You can count on NKO Volunteers to: help you, answer your questions, give you hints about any problems you might be facing while testing your app, give you a tip on which could be the best approach and more.

## Tokbox live chat rooms

Wait, there is more! Thanks to Tokbox, besides our IRC channel (#nodeknockout) and support mailing list (help@nodeknockout.com), we have video conferincing chat rooms, so you can discuss face to face with our volunteers your problems, using all the [opentok](https://opentokrtc.com/) and WebRTC goodness.
